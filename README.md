Task-03: SVM for Cat vs Dog Classification

ðŸ§° Tools Required
	â€¢	Python 3
	â€¢	Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, opencv or PIL

ðŸ”¶ Step-by-Step Implementation

1. ðŸ“¦ Dataset Preparation

Download the dataset from Kaggle Dogs vs Cats Dataset. After downloading:
	â€¢	Unzip the file.
	â€¢	Youâ€™ll get two folders: train/ and test/, each containing images like:
	â€¢	cat.0.jpg, dog.1.jpg, etc.

 2. ðŸ“¥ Load and Preprocess Images

Due to high resolution and count of images, SVM might struggle. So, weâ€™ll:
	â€¢	Resize images (e.g. to 64x64)
	â€¢	Flatten into vectors (4096 features for 64x64x1)
	â€¢	Normalize pixel values

 ðŸ”š Summary
	â€¢	SVM is effective for small image sets.
	â€¢	Preprocessing (resizing, grayscale, normalization) is key.
	â€¢	For better performance on full dataset, consider:
	â€¢	PCA to reduce dimensionality
	â€¢	Using LinearSVC for large-scale linear classification
	â€¢	Deep Learning models (like CNNs) for higher accuracy
